    "description": "<p>This project seeks to redraw landscapes through the lens of collective resistance and community. It challenges the notions of patriarchy, capitalism, whiteness, present in landscape by highlighting community driven and centered perspectives of place and space. A legacy that draws upon notions of “petit marronage”, Doreen Massey, and “under commons”. This is project that interweaves leisure, art, and resistance with narratives of black, queer, indigenous, and other normals often left to the fringe -- Where geography meets folklore meets art. </p>"
